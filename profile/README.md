## Introduction 



## Getting started 

### Git and GitHub

If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, watch these introductory videos: 
* How to use GitHub: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQsJR8ci3J0
* Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE

### GitHub account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one. Click *Sign Up* in the top right corner. 

### Membership

Once you have a GitHub account, ask Richard or Andrew to add you as a member of the Mason-Lab-Code organization. This will give you access to all of our code repositories.  

### Personal access token

To create a personal access token, follow the instructions available here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
When selecting scopes/permissions, tick “repo”. 
Make a note of your personal access token. Every time Git prompts you for a “password” on the command line, enter this personal access token (not the password for your GitHub account).
