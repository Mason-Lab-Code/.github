# Mason-Lab-Code

## Introduction 

### Mason-Lab-Code GitHub organization

The Mason-Lab-Code GitHub organization is a tool for sharing code between Mason Lab members. Scripts are organised into workflows. Each workflow has its own repository.  
Have a look at the Mason-Lab-Code repositories. Each workflow has its own repository, containing all of the scripts required to run the workflow. Repositories also contain a README file, detailing the function of each script, all software requirements, links to any reference files needed, and instructions on how to implement the workflow.  

### Viking group space (biol-cancerinf-2020) 

Group space for Mason Lab bioinformatics projects
Directory structure, centralised directories linked to Mason-Lab-Code org

## Getting started 

### Viking

What is Viking
Linux, Viking2 wiki tutorials  
Make sure you can login, do batch submissions, interactive sessions, use basic linux commands etc. 

### Viking account

### Git and GitHub

If you are unfamiliar with Git and GitHub, try watching these introductory videos: 
* [*How to use GitHub*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQsJR8ci3J0)
* [*Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop for beginners*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dd7KRpKeaE)

### GitHub account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one. Click *Sign Up* in the top right corner. 

### Membership

Once you have a GitHub account, ask Richard or Andrew to add you as a member of the Mason-Lab-Code organization. This will give you access to all of our code repositories.  

### Personal access token

* To create a personal access token, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).  
* Select "Tokens (classic)", not "Fine-grained tokens".  
* When selecting scopes/permissions, tick "repo".  
* Make a note of your personal access token.  
* Every time Git prompts you for a "password" on the command line, enter your personal access token (not the password for your GitHub account).  

## Executing a new project on Viking

### Naming system for files and directories

### Create new project directory

Name using naming system
Symlinks to raw files

### Run the workflow

Use symlinks  
Finding reference files (most genome indicies already exist)  
Custom bash scripting (template available), name using naming system  

### Using git [OPTIONAL]

For version control, backup, data/code sharing, and syncing projects across Viking2 and a personal workstation.  
.gitignore (template available)  

### Publish completed project on GitHub

Write README (template available), final push  

## Best practices

Lab books (template available), stick to naming system, store intermediate files in chronologically numbered directories, keep log files from batch submissions
